üöÄ VendorConnect: Revolutionary Street Food Supply Chain Platform
"What if I told you that a simple chaat vendor in Delhi could access the same supply chain intelligence as a Fortune 500 company? Welcome to VendorConnect - where we're democratizing supply chain management for India's 2.5 million street food vendors!"


"Street food vendors face a brutal reality - they're exploited by middlemen, lack market intelligence, and have zero negotiating power. A vendor buying onions at ‚Çπ40/kg doesn't know that the same onions are available at ‚Çπ22/kg just 2 kilometers away. This information asymmetry costs them thousands every month."
